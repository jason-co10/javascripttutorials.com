    <h1>Welcome to Javascript</h1>
    <P> This tutorial will be talking about javascript guides and tutorials. If this is confusing there will be a link at  the end of the tutorial, to show you and give you more guides and tutorials on Javascript as it is where this information was found. And it will be short for beginners to understand quick you'll not need to sign up or login for the website it is free access, but if you want to you can by pressing the button above saying login or sign up</P>
    <h2>What is Javascript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

    <h3 style="color: rgb(230, 9, 94);">Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>You'll need a editor to run and try it yourself. Editors you can use to run and try the code yourself is :
        Brackets, Visual studio code. those are not the only but we recommend using that</p>
    <h1>Starting of the tutorial</h1>
    <h2>1.Strings</h2>
    <p>Start learning JavaScript with us by typing in your first name surrounded by quotation marks, and ending with a semicolon. For example, you could type a name like this:</p>
    <button type="button">"Jamie";</button>
    <h2>2. Functions</h2>
    <p>Great job, Jamie! In JavaScript, when we surround a word with quotes it's called a string, and when we're done with a line of code we finish it with a semicolon.

        JavaScript also has built-in features, called functions. In order to call a function, we simply write its name (this time without quotes) and end it with a set of parentheses. Try calling the<button type="button">alert</button> function as you see below.
        
        Don't be afraid when a box pops up — that's your code working, Jamie!
        </p>
        <button style="background-color: rgb(180, 60, 80);" type="button" onclick="alert('undefined')">alert();</button>
        <h2>
            3. String Function Parameter</h2>
            <p>
                Nice pop-up box, Jamie, but there wasn't much in it. How can we get that box to show your name?

Well, many functions (like the <button type="button">alert</button> function) can take instructions, which we call parameters. By sending a string into the <button type="button">alert</button> function, we can put text on the pop up box.try it </p>
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Jamie')">alert("Jamie");</button>
<h2>4. Variables</h2>
<p>
    Often when programming we want to store values in containers so we can use them later; these are called variables. Let’s store your name in a variable, or ‘var’ for short, by typing the following:
</p>
<button type="button">var firstName = "Jamie";</button>
<h2> 
    5. Variable value
</h2>
<p> 
    Now we have a variable called <button type="button">firstName</button> that has a string stored inside of it. Output it to see what it looks like.
</p>
<button type="button">firstName;</button>
<h2> 
    6. Numbers
</h2>
<p>Great! Notice how your name printed out on the screen below, showing you the value inside the variable.
    So far we have only worked with 1 value type (strings), but JavaScript has many! Another example of a value type is a number. Pass any number of your choosing into the alert function. Just like a function, a number does not get quotations.</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="alert('42')">alert("42");</button>
    <h2>
        7. Combining Numbers
    </h2>
    <p> 
        We can also do math in JavaScript! Combine any 2 numbers like so:
    </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="alert('42')">14 + 28</button>
    <h2>8. Combining Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        Great math skills! JavaScript not only can combine numbers — it can combine strings as well!
Create an alert that combines both your name and a string, like below:
    </p>
    <button type="button" onclick="alert('Jamie is the name')">alert(firstName + " is awesome!");</button>
    <h2>9.Buttons</h2>
    <p> Buttons are very usefull in Javascript and html as they are used everytime in an html and javascript file. If you already dont know how to make a button then there will be a box below containga code to a javascript and html button.</p>
    <textarea name="text" cols="30px" rows="10px"><button type="button" onclick="*Type what is going to happen when clicked*">*Name The button*</button></textarea>
    <p> That was the end of The tutorial if there are any mistakes then send me on my contact page and continue searching for more information because someday your be a programmer just like me.</p>
